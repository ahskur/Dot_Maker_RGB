Day 18 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge:


With help of colorgram I extracted the colors used in images and transformed into RGB tuples so I could randomize the color of each dot.


Some exercises I've done before completing the final challenge of the day are also present for help.


Made using Turtle Graphics and colorgram.py
