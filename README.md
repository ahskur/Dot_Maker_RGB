# Dot_Maker_RGB
 Using colorgram to extract image colors and make (luxury) dot paintings

Day 18 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge:
With help of colorgram I extracted the colors used in images and transformed into RGB tuples so I could randomize the color of each dot.
Some exercises I've done before completing the final challenge of the day are also present for help.


Made using Turtle Graphics and colorgram.py
